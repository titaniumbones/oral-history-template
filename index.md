## Ecotourism and the KCC

*Pema Bhutia presents the peculiar circumstances that led to the establishment of the KCC. While he provides an insightful narrative of the founders’ inspirations and the organization’s evolution, there were certain moments in the interview, when specific thoughts deserved further elaboration.*

The format of oral account is very useful, especially in this case, considering that we get the perspective of one of the KCC’s founding members, and we get an insight into their worldview and vision. Pema undoubtedly conveys a certain sense of honesty and passion in his account, that is best highlighted by his explicit description of tourists’ former practices: they leave ‘shit all over the scene’! <a href="javascript:seek(560)">Listen to this part from 9:20</a>

This personal investment in the project also shines through in the __language__ Pema uses, and a specific word – sacred – he constantly deploys in referring to the mountain. He puts a clear emphasis on the mountain’s sacredness, however, it is a word that is universally used in different religious and spiritual discourses. Thus, the interviewer could have inquired about what lies beyond sacredness, especially for the interviewee, how does he perceive the mountain’s sacredness, and how is it and its meaning significant in relation to the region’s culture. Nonetheless, this would have probably steered the conversation in a different direction and it is deserving of a separate discussion clearly.

The adherence to ‘ecotourism’ highlights Sikkim’s participation in globalisation, Pema refers to the concept they selected for several reasons. One of them was the advice they received from knowledgeable international travellers and American partners. It is fascinating to hear how the KCC was not an initiative born in isolation, but the ‘product’ of local and global ecological awareness, proactive experts and the international dissemination of sustainable methods like ecotourism.

## Ecotourism
> Ecotourism is best defined as ‘responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and sustains the well-being of local people’, [it] has been promoted as a non-consumptive use of nature and as a possible win–win development strategy, especially for underdeveloped areas […].[^first]  Furthermore, it should not only ‘conserve the environment’, but ‘improve the welfare of local people’ and ‘generate money in an ecologically and socially friendly way than other forms of land exploitation.’[^first]

There’s a sense of consciousness conveyed by Pema’s way of speaking, an awareness of feasible __development paths__ for Sikkim. His narrative construction has specific characteristics, always stressing ecological concerns and corresponding human activity. This attests to his profound knowledge and expertise, especially in relation to the fundamental importance of sustainable environmental practices for communities. It would have been fascinating to hear more about how the KCC fits into development trends in the region, more specifically Sikkim’s post-merger ‘decentralized spread of economic progress’.[^second]

He provides an excellent outline of what __factors__ shaped the KCC’s understanding of ecological problems and their connections to tourism, but at some moments, the interviewer should have inquired about the social and cultural implications of old and new tourism. For instance, Pema points to immigrants from Nepal, who cannot be rejected due to lack of regulation, taking jobs with trekking companies as a significant factor that inspired the KCC. While this is a very intriguing point, the underlying regional socio-economic conditions, different ethnic communities’ relationships, or any corresponding social tensions involving locals would have deserved some exposure. Furthermore, the audience is more than interested in how this transnational movement of people due to economic needs has transformed Sikkim’s culture, or even ecotourism’s potential social impacts.

The question of __agency__ around the organization is also a barely covered theme in the interview. While we get a concise history of the organization, we lack information on the individuals who formed it, and their individual backgrounds. The vague impression we get from Pema’s interview is that it was an initiative by local experts. Moreover, while public mobilisation is mentioned in relation to their initial waste-collection programme, we lack an understanding of the broader local population’s opinion, incentives and motivation.

Due to the constraining length of the interview, there were some rushed parts, that Pema clearly did not perceive significant enough to elaborate on. However, there were specific points that could have clarified the more operational and technical dimensions of the KCC.

He briefly mentions a green-house initiative, that should have deserved some follow-up questions, especially as it highlights how diverse the KCC’s portfolio has been and, possibly, the challenges it faced and the lessons it learned. This green-house effort – and most likely other unmentioned projects – must have shaped their eventual organizational direction and scope.

The KCC was initially supported by individual donations through its fundraising cultural programmes, but we lack an understanding of its current state. Pema is very obscure in the way he talks about how the NGO model is effective for them. The interviewer could have asked about the KCC’s funding model or the regulations that have been implemented to support NGOs in India.

Lastly, Pema’s oral account is clear and concise, but it lacks some narrative conventions – due to its raw and unedited formulation – that could elevate it to another level. Due to the nature of the organization’s activities, for instance its opposition of unregulated economic practices, there must have been some episodes of conflict with tourism agencies. Furthermore, the interview briefly touches on government approaches to regional development and how the KCC adapted to those. Thus, the KCC’s relationship with external actors could be a very fascinating story on its own with __conflict__, __compromise__, __concession__ and __cooperation__ all incorporated as themes.

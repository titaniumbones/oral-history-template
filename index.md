In this interview, the discussion was about a Bhutia discussing on ecotourism and how it impacts the locals’ economically. She believed that people are selfish. She connected the locals’ behavior with religion and claimed that God created a ‘bad creature,' human beings. She claimed that the community would not be motivated for conservation if there are no economic benefits in return. It is very appealing to the community she said, <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(103)"> “It is good because even people who ware uneducated or unskilled can run the business.” </a> Thus, she argued that it is the priority for the community to protect the environment because nature is why the tourism business flourishes. If not, the tourism business will decline, and it is dangerous for the community because people don’t have any social security.



When the interviewer touching on the question of the previous economic activity such as farming, she added, <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(270)">“In the modern time it is hard for people to rely on self-sustain economic activities like farming because the society has changed.”</a> But the interviewee expressed an interesting view when the interviewer asks if the people are happy. She said the economy of Sikkim has been bad for 15 years, 90% of Cardamom is dead, but people are still happy,<a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(329)"> “they will say ok, mountain people are very easy going.”</a>

In general, I think the interviewer raised questions that allow us to understand the economic aspects of the people of Sikkim and how ecotourism encouraged people to conserve the environment and change the economic structure of the local community. It is also interesting that the interviewee made a connection between religion to locals’ attitude towards conservation of the environment, from what we can understand her unpleasant and can see that the environment must have an impact because of economic development. The oral interview can be treated differently from another source because all of the content directly reflects Sikkim at present and the quotes can largely use as the first-hand source in the articles. However, the interviewer has remained much space for exploring through the interview. It seems like the ecotourism have created the impact to the local community economically but how about religion and custom, does it change? Are people more eager to change and use the resource benefit from ecotourism to further develop the Infrastructure? The interview does not go in-depth with the social change of the Sikkim and local community through the flourishing of ecotourism.

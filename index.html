          <h2>My Thoughts on the Pema Bhutia Interview </h2>
          <p>The conversation between KCC President Pema Bhutia and a researcher on June 29, 2017 sheds light on much of the KCC's early history. Much of the exchange discusses the need to reconcile tourism in Sikkim with environmental sustainability. Bhutia describes how environmentally negligent tourists in the 1990s led to the creation of the KCC. Bhutia recounts how tourists rapdily cut down trees for campfire, and polluted the environment with garbage and human waste. This information helps contextualize the original impetus behind the KCC's founding. That said, it may have been informative if the researcher also asked questions about tourism's impact on the human community of Sikkim. Bhutia does note that the local people and the tourist rarely interacted. But this says little about the real impact the tourism in 1990s had on people's lives.

          <p> Bhutia also recalls how at the time, eco-tourism, at least in Asia, was a new concept. He describes the stages the new organization went through. First, it cleaned up the mountain trial and removed the tourists' waste. Then the KCC sought to make tourism itself more sustainable. The researcher might have asked: given that novelty of eco-tourism in Asia, how did it get originate as a concept and policy? did the idea of eco-tourism develop organically and independently of developments in  western environmentalism? or did the KCC import the idea from the outside world to apply it locally?

            <p>
  At the end of the interview, Bhutia lists several successful collaborations with non-local organizations. These collaborations related to resource mapping and the cataloguing of plants, animals and folk tales. These positive collaborations contrasts with Bhutia's earlier mention of 1990s tourism agencies, who did not interact with the locals. It may have been worthwhile if the interviewer asked how these foreign agencies today are different and better from the 1990s. This would have direct  implications for a foreign outfit such as ourselves that is collaborating with the KCC.

            <p>
  Overall, this discussion provides an informative and intimate overview of the KCC's origins. Bhutia is able to recall eye witness accounts of the organization's early years. As such, the discussion is a useful oral record for understanding the KCC. However, the interviews limited scope leaves much of the social context from which the KCC emerged from unclear. The interview is limited almost entirely to the KCC's internal organization. While this is understandable considering Bhutia can only attest to what he knows and has experienced, it nonetheless may have been worthwhile to at least ask questions on the larger Sikkim community.  How did the local population react to the KCC? beyond volunteer help, to what degree were, and are, they involved?
